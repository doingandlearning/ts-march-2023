1. Create a function called delay that takes a number of milliseconds as input and returns a promise that resolves after that number of milliseconds.

2. Create a function called mapAsync that takes an array of any type and an async callback function that maps each element of the array to a new value. The function should return a promise that resolves with the array of new values when all async operations are complete.

3. Create a function called filterAsync that takes an array of any type and an async callback function that filters each element of the array. The function should return a promise that resolves with the filtered array when all async operations are complete.

4. Create a class called Cache that stores a map of key-value pairs. The class should have a method called get that takes a key as input and returns a promise that resolves with the value corresponding to that key. If the key is not in the cache, the method should return a rejected promise. Use the KeyType and ValueType generic type parameters.

5. Create a function called reduceAsync that takes an array of any type, an initial accumulator value, and an async callback function that reduces the array to a new accumulator value. The function should return a promise that resolves with the final accumulator value when all async operations are complete.

6. Create a function called retry that takes a function and a number of retries as input. The function should call the input function and return a promise that resolves with the result if the function succeeds, or retries the function the specified number of times if it fails. Use the InputType and ReturnType generic type parameters.

7. Create a function called parallel that takes an array of async functions and runs them in parallel. The function should return a promise that resolves with an array of the results of each function in the same order as the input array.

8. Create a function called serial that takes an array of async functions and runs them in series. The function should return a promise that resolves with an array of the results of each function in the same order as the input array.

9. Create a class called Queue that stores a queue of items. The class should have a method called enqueue that adds an item to the end of the queue, and a method called dequeue that removes and returns the item at the front of the queue. Use the ItemType generic type parameter.

10. Create a function called memoizeAsync that takes a function and returns a new function that memoizes the results of the original function. The memoized function should use a cache to store the results of previous calls, and return the cached result if available. If the result is not available in the cache, the function should call the original function and store the result in the cache before returning it. Use the InputType and ReturnType generic type parameters.
