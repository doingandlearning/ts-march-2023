1. Write a pure function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with all numbers doubled.

2. Write a pure function that takes an array of strings and returns a new array with all strings uppercased.

3. Write a pure function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all even numbers.

4. Write a pure function that takes a string and returns the same string with all vowels removed.

5. Write a higher-order function called filterMap that takes a function fn that maps a value to a new value or undefined, and an array of values. It should return a new array with only the mapped values that are not undefined.

6. Write a higher-order function called memoize that takes a function and returns a new function that caches the results of previous calls with the same arguments.

7. Write a function called add that can take 2 or 3 arguments and returns the sum of those arguments. Use function overloading to implement this function.

8. Write a function called createPerson that can take a string name and a number age, or just a string name. If both arguments are provided, return an object with name and age properties. If only the name is provided, return an object with just the name property. Use function overloading to implement this function.

9. Write a function called parseDate that can take a string date and format string, or just a string date. If both arguments are provided, parse the date using the format string and return a Date object. If only the date is provided, parse it using a default format and return a Date object. Use function overloading to implement this function.

10. Write a function called findElement that can take a function that tests if an element matches a condition, or just a value to search for. If a function is provided, use it to test each element in an array and return the first element that matches. If a value is provided, return the first element in the array that matches that value. Use function overloading to implement this function.
