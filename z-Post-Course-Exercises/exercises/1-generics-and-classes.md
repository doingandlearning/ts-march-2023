Using the code from the generics and classes section:

1. Create a function called reverseArray that takes an array of any type as input and returns the reversed array. Use the ArrayType generic type parameter and the Array built-in type.

2. Create a class called AnimalShelter that stores a list of pets waiting to be adopted. The class should have a method called addPet that takes a pet as input and adds it to the list. Use the Pet interface and the LinkedNode interface.

3. Create a function called getBoxInside that takes a Box object as input and returns the value of the inside property. Use the Box interface.

5. Create a class called LoggerManager that has an array of Logger objects and a method called log that calls the log method on all the loggers in the array. Use the Logger interface and the BestLoggerEver class.

6. Create a function called sum that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. Use the InputType generic type parameter and the number built-in type.

7. Create a function called getSecondElement that takes an array of any type as input and returns the second element in the array. Use the ArrayType generic type parameter and the Array built-in type.

8. Create a class called HighSchool that extends the School abstract class. The HighSchool class should have a method called getStudentTypes that returns an array of strings representing the different types of high school students.

9. Create a function called getBoxOutside that takes a Box object as input and returns the value of the outside property. Use the Box interface.

10. Create a class called Bird that implements the Animal interface. The Bird class should have a method called tweet that logs "Tweet tweet!" to the console when called.
