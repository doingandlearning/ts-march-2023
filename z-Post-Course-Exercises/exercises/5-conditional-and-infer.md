1. Define a type IsArray<T> that checks if T is an array. If T is an array, the type should be true, otherwise it should be false.
2. Define a type Last<T> that returns the last element of an array T.
3. Define a type Flatten<T> that flattens an array of arrays T into a single array.
4. Define a type PartialDeep<T> that makes all properties of an object T optional recursively.
5. Define a type Omit<T, K> that omits the property K from the object T.
6. Define a type UnionToIntersection<T> that converts a union type T into an intersection type.
7. Define a type UnwrapPromise<T> that unwraps the type of a promise T.
8. Define a type PickByType<T, U> that picks the properties from an object T that have the type U.
9. Define a type Mutable<T> that makes all properties of an object T mutable.
10. Define a type RequiredDeep<T> that makes all properties of an object T required recursively.
